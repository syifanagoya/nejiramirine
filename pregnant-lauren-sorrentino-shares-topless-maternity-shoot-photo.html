Pregnant <strong>Lauren Sorrentino</strong> posted a stunning photo from her maternity shoot on Tuesday, April 27.</p><p>“Family of three (plus [Moses]) coming soon,” the<a href=#> Jersey Shore: Family Vacation</a> star, 36, captioned a <a href=# rel=noopener>picture</a> with her husband, <a href=#><strong>Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino</strong></a>, and their dog. In the family photo, the New Jersey native covered her chest with both hands while wearing unbuttoned jeans.

It does have a special meaning. We did have, like, three top names that we loved and the first two were just not sticking. This third one was like, ‘That’s it.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/See-Pregnant-Lauren-Sorrentino-Topless-Maternity-Shoot-Pic-Promo.jpg><p>She went on to tell Us about her nerves ahead of delivery, which she feels are “normal.” The pregnant star explained, “Just to make sure everything’s safe and healthy. I’m more excited. I’m not nervous about the pain or anything like that. I feel like I can take so much in life, and I’m just excited to finally meet him and start our new life.”</p><p>Her husband predicted a “smooth” delivery without “fist-pumping music,” adding, “I was told to bring in a portable speaker into the delivery room to play music so that it’s got good vibes going on. … We don’t agree on movie choices and music choices, [so we’ll] start with whatever she wants.”</p><p>Once their little one arrives, the reality stars have <a href=#>agreed</a> not to let their costar <a href=#><strong>Angelina Pivarnick</strong></a> babysit their son under any circumstances. As for <a href=#><strong>Vinny Guadagnino</strong></a>, the pair would “eventually let” the Double Shot at Love star, 33, step up to the plate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGapqpWcu6K602ajmq2imrtuv86rqZ6mpJ67sHnSoZirnaNiwbC8y56qrGWdlsGmvs2iq7Jlo528sMCMqZ%2BorJ9k</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
