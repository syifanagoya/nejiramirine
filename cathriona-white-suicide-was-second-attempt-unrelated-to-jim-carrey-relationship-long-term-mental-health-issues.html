A message from her biological mother just days before her death may have <a rel=nofollow href=#>pushed the young woman over the edge this time</a>.</p><p>Sources spoke to TMZ and revealed that Cathriona tried to take her own life after her father died three years ago. Sources also shed some light on what happened in the days that led up to the young make-up artist’s death – and Cathriona’s reasons behind taking her own life may have nothing to do with Jim Carrey. A hateful message from her biological mother <a rel=nofollow href=#>may have pushed White over the edge</a>.</p><p>Information has emerged that Cathriona received a hurtful message from her biological mother from whom she was estranged. Sources revealed to <a rel=nofollow href=#>TMZ</a> that friends say that in the message the woman called her daughter a “failure.” White allegedly received this letter on her birthday – just a few days before she took her own life. The day that Cathriona died was the third anniversary of her father’s death.</p><p>There are a few indicators that the beautiful young woman was struggling to find herself – including dabbling in Scientology. She had recently completed the Purification Rundown which is part of the training the Church uses to help individuals learn how to apply Scientology principles to better improve their own spiritual understanding and ability to help others to do the same. Why would the 28-year-old be perceived as a failure in the eyes of her estranged mother?</p><p>Just a few days after receiving the message from her biological mother <a rel=nofollow href=#>Cathriona White overdosed on a combination of four drugs</a> – Ambien, Zofran, Percocet and Propranolol. All these prescription medications had been prescribed by the same doctor to an alias Jim Carrey used in order to protect his privacy. No details have been released regarding how these medications came to be in her possession.</p><p>Loved ones probably will never have all their questions answered as to why Cathriona White took her own life – the ones left behind rarely do. It does seem as if a combination of the hateful message from her mother, the third anniversary of her father’s death and the breather from Jim Carrey may have contributed to Cathriona’s suicide.</p><p>Why would a mother call her daughter a failure – a young woman who was just beginning to find her place in the world? And why would a mother send that message just days before the anniversary of the death of her father? A family should come together to support each other on those anniversaries – not try to tear each other down.</p><p>Come back to CDL for updates on this tragic story as it unfolds as well as all your other celebrity news, gossip and rumors.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaG5nk5bBqb7IqKWaZaedtrWxjKysopuZmbJuw8CsZKydk6S7pXnArauepaCpera60Z6jmqyVmXq1u4yjoKZlk5a%2Fs7HYZqmepJGptrC60qGgqWWcpLuoedOeqaZlnZq7ta3LZp%2BemZyptW610qysnqtf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
