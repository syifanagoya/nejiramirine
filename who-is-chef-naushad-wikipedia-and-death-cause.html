Get To Know The Filmmaker<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Chef Naushad is widely recognized by the name of&nbsp;Naushad Big Chef. Here is the exact location of his catering service – National Highway Bypass Rd, Vyttila, Thammanam, Kochi, Kerala.</p><p>Most probably, the restaurant has some COVID-19 restrictions. Also, after Naushad fell ill, we believe the service is temporarily unavailable.</p><p>Moreover, he is a respected filmmaker in India. Well, he had once worked as an actor in the 2010 movie, Best Actor.</p><p>According to&nbsp;IMDb, he has been credited in at least 6 shows as a producer. Indeed, his works will forever remain in the heart of all the Malayalam people.</p><p>Moving on, recent internet rumors say that Naushad has passed away. However, the news is not true at this point.</p><p>India Glitz&nbsp;reported that the chef was admitted at&nbsp;Thiruvalla Hospital. Reportedly, he is in a critical condition and is under ventilator support.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-chef-naushad-on-wikipedia></span>Is Chef Naushad on Wikipedia?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Chef Naushad is one of the personalities who deserve a Wikipedia page.

Indeed, her demise is also a major reason behind his hampered health.</p><p>Multiple reports claim that the couples have a daughter. Well, their child is going through a lot at the moment.</p><p>Losing a life partner is the saddest thing that can happen to a person. Despite being a happy personality, Naushad couldn’t take the weight of his spouse’s death.</p><p>Hopefully, Naushad will find the strength to overcome his illness. We pray for his family at this difficult time.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=chef-naushad-death-cause-did-he-really-die></span>Chef Naushad Death Cause: Did He Really Die?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There’s nothing to know about Chef Naushad’s death cause.
