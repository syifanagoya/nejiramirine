On Christmas Eve, she posted a nine-minute long video singing about her followers’ hopes for 2021 to her own guitar accompaniment, and she ended the clip with a reprise of “Black Sheep,” the song that she performed in 2010 movie <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World</strong></a>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=292 data-current-count=292 data-injectable=false>In this seriously underrated Edgar Wright film, Larson played Envy Adams, Scott Pilgrim’s ex-girlfriend and the lead singer of The Clash at Demonhead (which also boasts former Superman Brandon Routh on bass). <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It’s a stone-cold banger and her performance is a highlight of the pic</a>.</p><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=714 data-injectable=true>For my money, Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World making only half of its $85 million budget back at the box office is one of cinema’s greatest injustices, as it’s an amazing film with a ton of awesome gags and shows off Wright’s many directorial talents. Since its release, it’s built up a sizeable cult following, receiving praise from cinema scholars for its incredible editing and transmedia narrative.</p><p data-characters=481 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true>This year’s tenth anniversary was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">set to be marked with a 4K remaster theatrical re-release</a>, but COVID-19 put an end to that. There was an online watch party featuring the cast and crew, though, during which they reminisced about the movie and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in a retrospective article in Entertainment Weekly</a>, Wright commented that he was still “incredibly proud of the [film]. The fact that you’re not doing a 10th-anniversary article about <i>The Expendables</i> says it all.”</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1920x1080_px_Scott_Pilgrim_Scott_Pilgrim_Vs_The_World-1017809.jpg alt="Scott Pilgrim vs. The World" width=1600 height=900 sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>Fans of the flick have one more celebration left to come, too. There was a very well received video game tie-in that was removed from online storefronts in the early 2010s. But after years in the wilderness and a long fan campaign, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game is now being re-released on PC and consoles on January 14th, 2021.</p><p data-characters=132 data-current-count=468 data-injectable=false>In the meantime, you can stream <strong>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World&nbsp;</strong>on Netflix and Prime Video, so give it a whirl.
