Per the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>, he was banned from more than 1500 radio stations, <a href=#>suspended by his record label "indefinitely,"</a>&nbsp;and was <a href=#>deemed ineligible and barred entry into award shows</a>. He was also <a href=#>dropped by his talent agency</a> and also faced <a href=#>intense scrutiny from fellow country artists</a> as well as Twitter as a whole.</p><p>That backlash prompted Wallen to go to rehab. "I went and checked myself into rehab. And for 30 days, I&nbsp;spent some time out in San Diego. Just trying to figure it out: Why am I acting this way? Do I have an alcohol problem? Do I have a deeper issue?" he told <a href=#>"Good Morning America."</a>&nbsp;He also donated more than $500,000 to Black-owned organizations after the scandal was made public.&nbsp;</p><p>But the controversy only strengthened his career â€” and the boost in album sales only proved to some critics that racism was not only prevalent in country music, but welcomed by some fans. Time will tell if Morgan Wallen has, indeed, learned his lesson in this situation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbW5pZoBye9OhnGaqlZa5br7Emqqopl2ivLOzwKdksJmcobKvedaepa1lpKR6s7HHmplo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
