Her eldest son, <strong>King Charles III</strong>, was officially crowned king and his coronation took place in May 2023.</p><p>Elsewhere in the book, a former royal aide claimed that <a href=#>Elizabeth wasn’t happy</a> with the situation surrounding <strong>Prince Harry</strong> and <strong>Meghan Markle</strong>’s decision to name their daughter, Lilibet, after the late monarch.</p><p>The former member of the queen’s staff claimed she was “as angry as I’d ever seen her” when Harry, 39, and Meghan, 42, claimed that they had spoken with Elizabeth before naming their child. The aide alleged that the Sussexes were “rebuffed” when they asked the palace to counter a report that they hadn’t asked Elizabeth her permission to use her name.</p><p>Harry and Meghan welcomed daughter Lilibet in June 2021, noting that her name is a nod to her great-grandmother, “whose family nickname is Lilibet.” Her middle name, Diana, was a tribute to Harry’s late mother, <strong>Princess Diana</strong>. (The pair also share son Archie, 4.)</p><p>Despite these claims, a source <a href=#>exclusively told Us Weekly</a> that Harry and Meghan “100 percent got permission” from Elizabeth to use the name Lilibet.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“The report is not true. [Harry and Meghan] don’t know where this is coming from,” the insider said on Tuesday, January 16. “They’re shocked that this is coming now; it seems out of nowhere and out of left field. They just feel like it’s more of the same spear campaign that continues against them.”</p><p>The source added that “multiple people are aware” that Harry and Meghan got Elizabeth’s blessing, adding that “they feel it’s convenient” the news is “surfacing now when the queen is not here to defend herself and can’t say what is true or false.”</p><p>The Making of a King: King Charles III and the Modern Monarchy is out now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabp6KewG62zqGlrKeeYrGqsM2tZK2dnKF6ssHEnqVmnZyex6KuxK2fZqGZYrWqv4ydpqBlm565rbHDZp%2Beql2oxKK6jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
