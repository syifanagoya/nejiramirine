But, to his credit, he's not hiding from or denying his bad fortune. In fact, he's being extremely public about it all.</p><p>First up, fake Pokemon cards.</p><p>Last month Logan revealed that he had paid $3.5 million for a case of six first-edition "base set Pokemon card booster boxes." I don't know what the second half of that previous sentence even means, but I do understand the concept of paying $3.5 million for something. And if I ever paid $3.5 million for something, I can't imagine the pain I would feel finding out the thing I bought was fake.</p><p>Unfortunately for Logan, that may be what happened.</p><p>Soon after announcing his purchase, a team of amateur investigators from a Pokemon fan news site called PokeBeach dug into Logan's apparent purchase. Their emphatic conclusion? Whatever Logan bought was fake.</p><p>Upon hearing the news Logan announced over Twitter on Wednesday that he was "flying to Chicago this weekend to verify the case with BBCE, the company who insured its authenticity."</p><p>Hopefully he has some sort of recourse!</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-327741 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/pokemon.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" onerror='this.width="1",this.height="1"' style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-327741 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Cliff Hawkins/Getty Images)</p><p>While we're on the subject of Pokemon cards, in the above photo Logan is wearing a Pokemon card around his neck during a press conference ahead of his <a href=#>Floyd Mayweather</a> fight. He ended up wearing this Pokemon necklace as he walked into the ring the next day. This Pokemon reportedly set him back $1 million. No word yet on whether it's fake or real.</p><p>Unfortunately, Logan's fight against <a href=#>Floyd Mayweather</a> is the source of his second financial hardship this week.</p><p>On Thursday, Logan claimed over Twitter that Floyd has yet to pay him his share of their earnings from their June boxing match.</p><p>For the fight, Logan negotiated a deal that would pay him a base salary of $250,000 plus 10% of Pay Per View profits. Mayweather was guaranteed $10 million to show up plus a whopping 50% of the PPV profits.</p><p>The fight was purchased by approximately 1 million people. Therefore, Floyd earned an estimated $35 million and Logan should be owed around $5.25 million.</p><p>After seeing someone on Twitter claim that "Floyd Mayweather earned so much from Logan Paul fight he could buy <a href=# title="Jeff Bezos Net Worth">Jeff Bezos</a>' jet," Logan replied:</p><p>"<strong>Yeah because the dirty little rat hasn't paid me yet lolâ€¦</strong>"</p><p>He accompanied that with a now-deleted Instagram story that said:</p><p>"<strong>Pay me my money you f***ing corny weasel of a human.</strong>"</p><p>Thoughts and prayers to you Logan.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxnC4zqCYp2WglsKtecKlmKKlo2KzrbvYnWSmmamssqLAx56pZqCRqLu1ec%2BaoJ1lmJ66brLOq2StoJWev26yyKCfrWWRo7FutMRmpJqxXZ2ut7GMqZiinF1oenZ5zKKjpaGfo3qnu9FmnZqjlWK9sLfEpqanZZOWv6W%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
