The <a href=#>66-year-old performer</a> grew up on an Oklahoma cattle ranch surrounded by a loving family that she remains close with today.

Her mother, also a singer, was a <a href=#>powerful influence</a> in getting her career started. As far as siblings are concerned, Reba McEntire has two sisters and one brother. Together they would tour the country with their parents, <a href=#>performing at rodeos</a> throughout the Midwest as the Singing McEntires.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_63>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wide Open Country</a>, McEntire’s older brother Pake signed to RCA Nashville in 1986. His biggest hit, “Savin’ My Love for You,” peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard chart. Pake put out a few more albums, with minor success, until finally deciding to hang up his microphone. He now runs a 1,000-acre cattle ranch in Oklahoma, continuing his family’s passion for rodeo.</p><p id=par-4_35>Alice Foran is McEntire’s older sister and the only sibling that did not pursue a singing career. A retired social worker living in Oklahoma, she has stayed out of the spotlight throughout her sister’s fame.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_50>“The Heart Won’t Lie” singer also has a younger sister, Susie McEntire-Eaton. In the early ’80s, the two women toured together, and Susie was featured on two of McEntire’s albums.
