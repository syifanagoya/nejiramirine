After two years, its fan will finally be going to know about the fallout from its exceptional cliff-hanger ending.</p><p>With the success of the American satirical comedy TV series, <strong>Succession</strong>, the makers recently released <strong>Succession 3</strong>, growing the fans’ curiosity.&nbsp;</p><p>Succession firstly premiered on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HBO</a> in June 2018, while the series’s second season was released in August 2019. The makers recently released the first episode of Succession Season 3 in October 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>Take a peek at more information about the show and what happend at the end of its 2nd season.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Succession Season 3 Release Date</h2><p>Episode 1 of Succession season 3 was released on October 17, 2021, at 9 pm ET on HBO and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HBO Max</a>, on which the first episode went on air. Next episodes are set to onair every Monday evening.</p><p>The show’s official account tweeted the date in September, having formerly affirmed that season 3 would premiere in the “<strong>last quarter of 2021.</strong>”&nbsp;</p><p>Coincidentally, it is the October 17 release date, almost the second anniversary of the season 2 finale, which aired on October 13, 2019.</p><p>Both the previous seasons were released during the summers of 2018 and 2019. Considering that season 3 was commissioned by HBO only two episodes into season 2, a summer 2020 launch made sense – that is, before the arrival of Covid-19.</p><p>Amid the pandemic-induced chaos, WarnerMedia <a href=#>Entertainment</a> closed production on all its series, including Succession and Barry, which ruled out season 3’s expected 2020 release date.</p><p>Writing for the new season did continue, though, and cast members hinted at a 2021 return following confirmation that filming got back underway in February.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Number of Episodes Are In Succession Season 3</h2><p>There will be nine episodes in total in Season 3. That’s one episode more concise than regular, as the first two seasons of Succession had ten episodes each, likely due to production changes.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Here’s when the ‘Succession’</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Season 3 episodes have been expected to release:</strong></h3><ul><li>Episode 1 – Sunday, October 17, 2021</li><li>Episode 2 – Sunday, October 24, 2021</li><li>Episode 3 – Sunday, October 31, 2021</li><li>Episode 4 – Sunday, November 7, 2021</li><li>Episode 5 – Sunday, November 14, 2021</li><li>Episode 6 – Sunday, November 21, 2021</li><li>Episode 7 – Sunday, November 28, 2021</li><li>Episode 8 – Sunday, December 5, 2021</li><li>Episode 9 – Sunday, December 12, 2021</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Succession Season 3 Episode Titles</h2><p>So far, only eight titles of Succession Season 3’s first eight episodes are disclosed. The finale’s title is currently a secret, which makes its fans wonder if it could be a spoiler. Below are the titles of subsequent episodes of The Succession.</p><ul><li>Secession</li><li>Mass in Time of War</li><li>The Disruption</li><li>Lion in the Meadow</li><li>Retired Janitors of Idaho</li><li>What It Takes</li><li>Too Much Birthday</li><li>Chiantishire</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Where Did The Season 2 of Succession End?</h2><p>Succession season 2 ended with Kendall Roy lobbing a bombshell on his father’s dynasty, naming Logan Roy as “<strong>a malignant presence, a bully and a liar.</strong>”&nbsp;</p><p>The Number One Boy decided to backstab media tycoon Logan Roy—who set up his son to take the fall for Waystar Royco’s wrongdoings—throwing a major twist into the patriarch’s plans for his heirs. Roman Roy also ascended to COO of the company, while Cousin Greg, clutching those ever-incriminating emails, pulled his battle lines and aligned with Kendall.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Can You watch Succession season 3?</h2><p>Succession will be unrestricted on HBO and streaming on HBO Max starting at 9 pm ET on Sunday, October 17. Season 3 will be a shortened nine-episode run (instead of the standard 10), with its finale slated for December 12. It’s time to renew the subscription to HBO Max.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Chance for Season 4 of Succession to Come</h2><p>On October 26, HBO officially gave the green signal of the fourth season of this successful family drama.</p><p>Francesca Orsi, executive vice president of HBO Programming, declared in a statement, “<strong>With each season of Succession, Jesse Armstrong has continued to surpass our wildest expectations, pulling us deeper into the Roy family’s inner sanctum with indelible wit, humanity, and precision. This season is undoubtedly no exception, and we couldn’t be more excited for all that’s in store in this next season ahead.”</strong></p><p>But whispers are echoing that the fourth season could be the series’ last season.&nbsp;</p><p>Talking with U.K. newspaper The Times, Succession writer and executive producer Georgia Pritchett disclosed, “<strong>I think the maximum would be five seasons, but possibly more like four.</strong>” She continued, teasing that showrunner Jesse Armstrong and the creative team have “<strong>a good end in sight.</strong>“</p><p>And in a recent interview, Armstrong himself said he already has “<strong>a pitch</strong>” for how he expects the series finale to evolve, though he played more coy about when precisely that may be. “<strong>All I know is there’s a promise in the ‘Succession’ title, and it can’t go on forever,</strong>” he added.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Final Words</h2><p>After that season 2 finale, there are many expectations to be grown up, and if the progress between seasons is anything as evident as last time, we expect season 3 will be a real treat.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunDAx55krK2TmLK0v8iopWarlZbAsLqMbGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
