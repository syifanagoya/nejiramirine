"I was in college driving back and forth from Myrtle Beach to Atlanta to work on 'The Originals' and 'Stranger Things,'" she said. "I realized that something had to give." She added that, although she wanted to continue her studies in school, she knew she needed to at least give acting full-time a shot, so she dropped out, packed up her car, and traveled to Los Angeles.</p><p dir=ltr>Once Cline got to Los Angeles, she admitted that it was frightening because of the stiff competition with other wannabe actors. "I realized there are thousands of me," she told <a href=#>Flaunt</a>. "And that was really scary."</p><p dir=ltr>But Cline proved that hard work and a lot of motivation pays off, as she soon booked the role of Sarah Cameron in the hit Netflix show "Outer Banks," which ended up being her breakthrough role. She then went on to play the role of Whiskey in "Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery" alongside Daniel Craig, Kathryn Hahn, Edward Norton, and Kate Hudson. And at the same time, one of her "Outer Banks" co-stars was in the same boat as her when it came to his acting career.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampiaYVyhI6hprBlnZaxprjYp2ScpJmjsrR5waKrZqqfobJuu81mqq2qkaO0pr6MrZ%2BippeoeqS0wKeenpxdnbKzecuinZ5n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
