From relaxation suites furnished with water beds, treatments that require tucking you in under sumptuously fluffy duvets, and changing rooms stocked with the latest Dyson hairdryers and beautifying gadgets, every aspect has been designed with luxury in mind. Not to mention the interiors, often glammed up with jazzy décor and design that references a hotel's heritage, or sometimes simply a sleek, Cararra marble-clad steam room will impress. Relax, Dubai has you covered.&nbsp;</p><a href=# data-tmg-dtm-nav=image></a>Helicopter tours from the hotel’s helipad and water bed recliners in the spa hint at the opulence in this palatial pile situated on the artificial island of Palm Jumeirah. An extensive array of facilities include hydrotherapy and thermal relaxation rooms, water flotation lounges, a traditional Arabic Attar perfumery and 12 treatment rooms. Neom treatments feature molten butter massages using skincare candles made from comforting cocoa and shea butters loaded with essential oils, leaving the skin buttery-soft for hours. <span class="link-wrapper travel-product-card__review-link" data-ampclass=link-wrapper><a class=link data-ampclass=link href=#>Read expert review</a></span> <span class="travel-price__prefix e-price__heading" data-ampclass=travel-price__prefix>From</span> <span class="travel-price__wrap e-price__wrapper" data-ampclass=travel-price__wrap><span class="travel-price__symbol e-price__currency" data-ampclass=travel-price__symbol itemprop=currenciesAccepted content="GBP">£</span> <span class="travel-price__price e-price__fee" data-ampclass=travel-price__price>122</span></span><p>• <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">An insider's guide to Dubai</a></p><a href=# data-tmg-dtm-nav=image></a>There’s no getting round it, W Dubai – The Palm is a party palace, and its achingly cool interiors and music links are an homage to that. In rooms, some walls undulate, sparkling like inky disco balls with a covering of dark glass tiles, while others are daubed with ‘calligraffiti’ – sprawling Arabic text spelling out the lyrics to a song about love being as vast as the ocean. Even the spa’s interiors have been glammed up with jazzy décor and design that references Dubai’s pearl diving heritage. Among the facilities are 11 treatment rooms, steam room, sauna, experiential shower and whirlpool – perfect for a post-party pamper. <span class="link-wrapper travel-product-card__review-link" data-ampclass=link-wrapper><a class=link data-ampclass=link href=#>Read expert review</a></span> <span class="travel-price__prefix e-price__heading" data-ampclass=travel-price__prefix>From</span> <span class="travel-price__wrap e-price__wrapper" data-ampclass=travel-price__wrap><span class="travel-price__symbol e-price__currency" data-ampclass=travel-price__symbol itemprop=currenciesAccepted content="GBP">£</span> <span class="travel-price__price e-price__fee" data-ampclass=travel-price__price>220</span></span><p>• <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The best family-friendly hotels in Dubai</a></p><a href=# data-tmg-dtm-nav=image></a>The first Caesars Palace outside of Las Vegas brings a touch of ancient Rome to Dubai.

There's something for everyone: a trendy private beach club, a Pantheon-style theatre, and cutting-edge Qua Spa. Expect unique treatments like the Japanese Iyashi Dome infrared capsule, which burns up to 600 calories per session; the city's only warm quartz bed, which inclines for gravity treatments; and the indulgent gold dust and touch of silk massage. <span class="link-wrapper travel-product-card__review-link" data-ampclass=link-wrapper><a class=link data-ampclass=link href=#>Read expert review</a></span> <span class="travel-price__prefix e-price__heading" data-ampclass=travel-price__prefix>From</span> <span class="travel-price__wrap e-price__wrapper" data-ampclass=travel-price__wrap><span class="travel-price__symbol e-price__currency" data-ampclass=travel-price__symbol itemprop=currenciesAccepted content="GBP">£</span> <span class="travel-price__price e-price__fee" data-ampclass=travel-price__price>260</span></span><p>• <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The best restaurants in Dubai</a></p><p>• <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The best luxury hotels in Dubai</a></p><a href=# data-tmg-dtm-nav=image></a>Often referred to as one of the Emirates' most romantic resorts, One&Only The Palm sets the relaxing tone of its detail-driven service the moment you arrive, with frosted fragranced towels and crystal tumblers of iced tea.
