At the time, she was starring on the ABC sitcom,&nbsp;Ellen, and her&nbsp;character likewise <a href=#>came out</a>. With&nbsp;<a href=#>The New York Times</a> reporting that some advertisers became squeamish about seemingly endorsing homosexuality, pulling commercial spots from her show, the series was ultimately&nbsp;<a href=#>cancelled</a>&nbsp;in 1998.&nbsp;</p><p>This was a dark time for DeGeneres, who told&nbsp;<a href=#>Out</a>&nbsp;magazine in 2016 that&nbsp;she&nbsp;"wasn't sure if [she] was going to work again," admitting,&nbsp;"I was at rock bottom and out of money, with no work in sight." Of the subsequent coming out backlash and cancellation, the comedian revealed on Dax Shepard's&nbsp;Armchair Expert&nbsp;podcast (via <a href=#>Today</a>), "It hurt my feelings ...&nbsp;I was really depressed ... I was looked at as a failure in this business. No one would touch me. I had no agent, no possibility of a job, I had nothing."</p><p>Ultimately, DeGeneres' confidence had been shaken, as she explained to&nbsp;<a href=#>USA Today</a>, "Whenever you carry shame around, you just can't possibly be a confident person." It wasn't until she realized she had nothing to be ashamed about that she regained her confidence, saying, "Depression eats away at your confidence and you get lost in that."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2tna4V2e9OrmKChk2KxpsDAoqOsZZGXvLbAjJ6jpZ2eYrGms8SnnKudo2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
