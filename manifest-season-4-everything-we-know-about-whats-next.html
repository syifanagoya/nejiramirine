NBC canceled <a href=#>Manifest</a> despite its shocking season 3 finale cliffhanger. Luckily, <a href=#>Netflix saved the day, ordering a fourth and final season</a>, thanks to a new crop of fans desperate to find out <a href=#>what happened to Flight 828</a>.</p><p>The network pulled the plug on Manifest in June 2021, days after the two-part finale aired. Viewers hoping that the episode would wrap up loose ends in the story were disappointed, as&nbsp;even&nbsp;more twists were introduced into the series’ expansive landscape.</p><p>Grace (<strong>Athena Karkanis</strong>) — spoiler alert — seemingly died after an altercation with Angelina (<strong>Holly Taylor</strong>) as the 828 passenger abducted Grace and Ben’s (<a href=#><strong>Josh Dallas</strong></a>) baby, Eden. Meanwhile, the couple’s son, Cal (<strong>Jack Messina</strong>), returned in the form of a teenager (<strong>Ty Doran</strong>) after going missing when he touched the plane’s tailfin. Plus, the love triangle between Michaela (<strong>Melissa Roxburgh</strong>), Zeke (<strong>Matt Long</strong>) and Jared (<strong>J.R. Ramirez</strong>) seemed&nbsp;to be&nbsp;reignited by old jealousies.</p><p>In tandem with the <a href=#>show’s&nbsp;cancellation</a>, seasons 1 and 2 made their debut on Netflix, taking up a lengthy stay in the streaming platform’s Top 10 list. As new viewers discovered the series, they were saddened to learn of its demise, which ramped up conversations about a<a href=#>&nbsp;season 4 renewal</a>.</p><p>Creator <strong>Jeff Rake</strong>, who initially <a href=#>sold the concept to NBC for six seasons</a> that were already mapped out, continued to advocate for the show’s continuation as conversations broke down about a renewal.</p><p>“We’re trying to find a way to conclude the series,” the writer <a href=#>tweeted</a> in June 2021. “Could take a week, a month, a year. But we’re not giving up. You deserve an end to the story.”</p><p>One way Rake hoped to give fans what they wanted was in the form of a movie. “I had giant cliffhangers in the season 3 finale, so I had every intention to have three more seasons to slow-burn the back half of the story,” he told <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a>. “I’m reading the writing on the wall that we may not find a home for three more seasons of the show, so I moved to plan B: Some platform would bankroll a feature or a movie finale, like we saw with Timeless, Firefly and Deadwood. I just need a modest budget to tell the story. I am personally sketching out how to consolidate the back half of the series into a much more streamlined, cut-to-the-chase two-hour finale that would distill all of the hanging chads of the series. That’s where my head is at.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>However, news broke in July 2021 that <a href=#>NBC and Netflix were once again in talks</a> with the show’s studio, Warner Bros. TV, about a possible fourth season. Netflix announced their deal for a 20-episode final season in August 2021. While Rake won’t get to see his six-season vision come to life, he will get the chance to answer all the mysteries of Flight 828 in the super-sized final chapter.</p><p>Scroll through the gallery for everything we know about what could come next for Manifest:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Birq%2B1xZ6qrWWjmq60u81ma2adppq%2FusDHoqWgZaeaeqy6zrBkmpqfqsFuw8eaq6xlnprFtXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
