She met her husband in 2012 at a bar, and they have kept a relatively low profile together ever since.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple tied the knot privately in 2013 while on a road trip in Iowa. On Sept. 13, 2019, they welcomed their first child, daughter <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kinsey Sioux</a>. Their son <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Wilder Wolf</a> was born on Aug. 17, 2021.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Culkin won best actor in a drama series</a> for his role in Succession at the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>2024 Golden Globes,</a> he took the opportunity to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>thank Charton</a> for "putting up with this and all the ... that comes with it."

The proud mom even partially credits herself for helping get Charton and Culkin together. As she wrote in one Instagram <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>caption</a>, she previously convinced her daughter to stay in N.Y.C., which eventually led her to meeting Culkin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In May 2023, she posted photos from a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>trip to her home city on Instagram</a>, including photos with family and friends and a snap of sweets that honored King Charles and his coronation.

But he didn't have a name for several weeks following his birth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>an appearance</a> on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a> later that year, the HBO star explained why it took the pair so long to settle on a name for their son.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My wife wanted Wolf. She was fighting hard for Wolf," Culkin shared. "We found [the name] in the hospital the day that he was born and we thought 'That's great.' But instead of pulling the trigger on it, [we thought], 'Let's torture ourselves for about seven weeks,' disagreeing with names before we come around to the name that we picked. 'Cause, we didn't know if we were having a boy or a girl."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He explained that they waited until right before Charton gave birth to brainstorm names. "So, she's in bed and we have a dry erase board so we can go over every name we thought of. And we were like 'Let's focus on girl names because we really like these,' " he recalled.
