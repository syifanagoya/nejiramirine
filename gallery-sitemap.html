They're working together,'" Blunt recalled of agreeing to work with her spouse on the critically acclaimed thriller. "It was the only idea that had come our way that seemed bigger than our marriage. The narrative of our marriage was not going to overwhelm this movie and this amazing opportunity for him as a director, as a filmmaker, as a writer. I knew this was a big swing for him."]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/John-Krasinski-Emily-Blunt-First-Date-Hollywood-Reporter-02.jpg?quality=40&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[Just as Lovely as They Seem]]>&lt;![CDATA["Neither of them has a jealous bone in their body,” Blunt’s Mary Poppins director Rob Marshall dished. “People think marriage is looking deep into each other's eyes.

"On top of it, there was nothing from Emily but love and support."]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/John-Krasinski-Emily-Blunt-First-Date-Hollywood-Reporter-06.jpg?quality=40&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[Maintaining Balance]]>&lt;![CDATA["We've always allowed and rejoiced in each other having a very full life outside of the other one," Blunt explained.]]><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn52VmXyorculnKuxXai2tbHMmqdod6OhwqiJxKagpbFdl7m2utNmoaignmK4s63SoqWso5liva2t2GaaqLFdlq%2BwwdNmq6Gdmad6p7XRrKtmnJGpsg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
