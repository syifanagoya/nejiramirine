But the rapper has in fact quietly built a "venture capital tech investment empire" over the last several years, and one of his investments has paid off in a big way. Media giant <a href=#>Viacom</a> has bought out online video streaming platform Pluto TV, which Nas' QueensBridge Venture Partners put undisclosed millions into back in 2014, for some $340 million.</p><p>Pluto TV is a free, ad-supported streaming service that lets users "flip" through channels of video from a wide variety of sources, an attempt to bring a dearly missed part of the cable experience back into the streaming era. And according to the press statement from Pluto TV's CEO and Co-Founder Tom Ryan, the Viacom buy makes perfect sense:</p><p><strong>"Since our launch less than five years ago, and particularly over the past year, Pluto TV has enjoyed explosive growth and become the category leader in free streaming televisionâ€¦ Viacom's portfolio of global, iconic brands and IP, advanced advertising leadership and international reach will enable Pluto TV to grow even faster and become a major force in streaming TV worldwide. Viacom is the perfect partner to help us accomplish our mission of entertaining the planet."</strong></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-276557 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-457502292.jpg alt width=900 height=599 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-276557 class=wp-caption-text>Noel Vasquez/Getty Images</p><p>Viacom's Pluto TV buy is only the latest investment success for Nas. In 2018, two companies invested in by QueensBridge were also sold for big bucks: Home "smart doorbell" brand Ring to Amazon for $1.1 billion in February, and online pharmacy Pillpack, also sold to Amazon in April for a sum reported to be just under a billion dollars.</p><p>QueensBridge now reportedly gets about a hundred pitches a month from companies hoping to become its next success story.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxnC6wKxkoqammsC1ucSnq2ahnmLAtb7EmqSippdiwKa%2B1aKanmWgocK1u4ytrWaoka7AbrvFn2SvoZGYvK55wa6wrGWZqXqnu9Fmam1oXaK2rbjIqKVo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
