It’s not like there’s even a Christmas miracle in the offing. It’s just more of the same.</p><p>And why in the world would Finn think he’d lose Steffy if Eric died? Geez, the man had one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel when he was admitted, and Steffy was all for having her father give permission to let Finn try his procedure—which he was extremely clear came with no guarantees at all. Also, Eric survived the surgery, so it didn’t do any additional harm. If Eric dies, it will not be due to the surgery, and without it, Ridge was going to pull the plug anyway. Would Steffy have blamed Ridge for Eric’s death if he’d done so?</p><p><span class=post-likes>7 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Cooper</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>December 18, 2023, 6:01pm <span itemprop=position>17</span></span><p>One other thing: if they’re trying to make Zende the villain, they’re going about it the wrong way. He has every right to feel like RJ is benefitting greatly from nepotism, especially since everyone now knows that the work he did with Eric did not result in a line that won the fashion show down. That was the one thing he had on his resume, beyond being the golden only child of Bridge. Beyond that, he’s incredibly inexperienced, having not decided designing was his calling until the say of the fashion show, which was, what, a month ago, tops? Zende has been working at FC for years and has produced successful lines as a co-designer with HFTF. He’s also a grandchild of Eric’s. Why shouldn’t he be considered for promotion over RJ, who’s younger, inexperienced, and has no formal training in fashion either. Not to mention having had no interest in becoming a designer until quite recently. If Thomas is so thoroughly Loganized that he wants to stay on at HFTF as opposed to doing couture with his father (though he recently did say he wished he had more time to do that), then why shouldn’t Zende be promoted to working as a junior designer on couture and have R.J. take over his co-designer role on HFTF?</p><p><span class=post-likes>6 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>plumb04</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>December 18, 2023, 6:12pm <span itemprop=position>18</span></span><p>It is such an insult to Zende’s character who is a long time adult, trained professional, & has been designing for almost a decade to be competing against RJ the nepo baby playing his way around the world. RJ should be an intern at most.</p><p>This reminds me of 16yr old Hope getting her own line just to block a more deserving Steffy. Brooke’s kids, outside of Bridget, get everything handed to them without even asking.</p><p><span class=post-likes>10 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Dee21gh</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>December 18, 2023, 7:05pm <span itemprop=position>19</span></span><p>They all benefited from nepotism, who else would hire their butts right off the bat?</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Cooper</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>December 18, 2023, 7:09pm <span itemprop=position>20</span></span><p>But not all of them got leap-frogged into designing. Steffy chose to start at the bottom and work her way up from the mailroom. Thomas was not just immediately put in as a designer. It’s only Brooke’s kids who seem to be able to pass go and run straight into whatever position they want.</p><p><span class=post-likes>12 Likes</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmpp2jqK6osYybppqqlKh8tXvBqKOdZZKarrbAyJ%2BspWWjpbyquMSrqmaen6d6uLHEpGSonl2ZsqSxzJucq2doZ31yhY8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
