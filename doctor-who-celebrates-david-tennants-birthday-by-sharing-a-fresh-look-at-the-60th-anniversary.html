Now, after his last appearance in 2013‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Day of the Doctor,‚Äù the Scottish thespian is picking up the TARDIS keys and the sonic screwdriver to bring back the 10th Doctor for one last time.</p><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>Of course, going by the show‚Äôs own moniker, David Tennant‚Äôs return will mark the fourteenth incarnation, with Ncuti Gatwa coming in after him as the Fifteenth Doctor. We still don‚Äôt know how this reprisal came to be, or what in-universe justification Russell T. Davies has cooked up for us, but we do know for certain that November can‚Äôt come soon enough.</p><p data-characters=170 data-current-count=550 data-injectable=true>Not convinced?

His final appearance as the main lead was in 2010‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe End of Time,‚Äù where the 10th Doctor finally regenerated into Matt Smith‚Äôs 11th.</p><p data-characters=452 data-current-count=452 data-injectable=true>That‚Äôs why the 60th-anniversary special is a monumental milestone for the long-running British sci-fi show. Not only is the show bringing back two beloved alumni in the form of David Tennant and Catherine Tate (Donna Noble), Russell T. Davies has contracted <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Neil Patrick Harris</a> for the story‚Äôs main enigmatic villain. And, of course, there‚Äôs the general gravitas and epicness that comes with Doctor Who anniversaries every few years.</p><p data-characters=124 data-current-count=124 data-injectable=false>At any rate, we join the rest of our fellow Whovians in wishing Tennant a continued and successful incarnation in this life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ylu8Ktpqtlp528bq%2FEpZybqpGpsrR5w5qtopxdqbKvusCnq6xlkp6%2FtbTDmrBmmqliwKmt0aKloGWRYrOzsdKhZKWnn6B6osCMrZ%2BeZWZlwal5wKeloq6Vp8Civtho</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
