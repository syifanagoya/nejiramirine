It’s the most abundant protein in the body, after all. It affects everything from skin, to hair, to bones and beyond! That’s why it’s such a popular supplement. Adding some quality collagen to your everyday routine could not only result in a more glowing complexion, but overall improved health!</p><p>One person who religiously uses collagen is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a>. The 40-year-old doesn’t look a day over 30, so when she says a brand is an everyday essential, we listen. Her favorite brand? Vital Proteins. She loves them so much that she even collaborated with them via Poosh! Want to get started on your own collagen regimen? <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Right this way</a>!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides Unflavored Dietary Supplement</a> (originally $49) for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$43 </a>at Amazon! Also available at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nordstrom</a>! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, January 8, 2020, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p>This unflavored collagen powder is sourced from grass-fed, pasture-raised bovine and is totally free of sulfates, phthalates, parabens, petrochemicals, mineral oil, silicone and talc. It’s also free of gluten, dairy and added sugar! Kardashian is the queen of all clean beauty and clean food, so we always know her picks will be just perfect.</p><p>This supplement has over 3,600 reviews on Amazon alone, with shoppers saying it’s the best value, with 20 grams of collagen per serving as well as 18 grams of protein. That means it’s not only improving their skin, hair and nails — but their overall diet too. They say their skin looks plumper, their fine lines vanishing and their hair and nails are growing faster while their joints feel less stiff. Even their doctors are amazed by the results!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides Unflavored Dietary Supplement</a> (originally $49) for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$43 </a>at Amazon!
