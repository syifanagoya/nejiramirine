She was an intensely private woman but her family handed over tons and tons of video she took of herself and her family through the years.</p><p>Big Donna fans may be a little disappointed that it’s not a chronicle of her songs and major musical events. It focuses more on her than just her music. It makes her 3-dimensional.</p><p>See it!!</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 6</td><td class=timestamp><span>May 12, 2023 1:32 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>I had never assumed she was only 2-dimensional.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 1</td><td class=timestamp><span>May 11, 2023 2:39 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>I loved the trailer. A lot of never before seen personal clips, rare concert footage and other things.</p><p>Maybe this will spur Universal to release some stuff. The filmed Live and More concert for starters.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 3</td><td class=timestamp><span>May 11, 2023 2:52 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>The movie addresses her supposed anti-gay quotes.</p><p>According to her husband, Bruce Sudano, she did say flippantly at a concert that “God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.” As controversy grew, she didn’t make any statements.</p><p>He said it morphed into rumors that she said AIDS is God’s curse against gays (among other homophobic things), which she absolutely never said. She finally did give a press conference denying the latter and, to her deathbed, she was heartbroken that anyone could think she would make those anti-gay statements.</p><p>So many of her friends and colleagues were gay men.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 4</td><td class=timestamp><span>May 12, 2023 1:25 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>The Bway musical Summer! also address the Adam and Steve line</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 5</td><td class=timestamp><span>May 12, 2023 1:26 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>She came into a CT gourmet deli I worked with in the late 80s, gf had the biggest hips/ass I had ever seen in my life.
