Not only that but the famous talk show host has also been making headlines over the â€˜toxicâ€™ work environment accusations and investigation.</p><p>It appears that, while quite a few celebrities have been defending Ellen DeGeneres, Ryan Phillippe is definitely not one of them!</p><p>The Big Sky actor made his stance on this matter very clear with a new post on social media.</p><p>It all started with the man doing an outdoor workout and coming across a billboard for The Ellen DeGeneres Show while he was out and about in Los Angeles.</p><p>That is when he decided to take a selfie and include the billboard in the back, posting it on his go-to platform with the caption: â€˜And remember to be kindâ€¦. Wait.â€™</p><p>This was definitely a reference to Ellenâ€™s catchphrase that seems to be rather ironic now since the things she has been accused of doing and saying are anything but kind.</p><p>Still, people online were rather shocked to see Ryanâ€™s post since he usually tends to keep a low profile in Hollywood.</p><p>Not only that but also, his former wife and fellow actress Reese Witherspoon, is a pretty good friend of Ellenâ€™s.</p><p>When it comes to Ryan, however, he has not been a guest on the talk show in years!</p><p>This comes after Ellen addressed and apologized for the toxic work environment multiple times.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>NOT RYAN PHILLIPPE SLYLY DISSING ELLEN ðŸ’€ <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/f4XRtgdEHq</a></p><p>â€” bathsheba (@MacArthurPerc) <a href=# rel=nofollow>October 25, 2020</a></p><p>Her first apology was made directly to the staff via a memo that read in part: â€˜On day one of the show, I told everybody that The Ellen DeGeneres Show would be a place for happiness â€” no one would raise their voice, and everybody would be treated with respect. Obviously, something changed, and Iâ€™m disappointed to learn this has not been the case. And for that, Iâ€™m sorry. Anyone who knows me knows it is the opposite of what I believe and what I hoped for our show.â€™</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>She later addressed the situation on the show as well but many are still not convinced she was sincere.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeirq6vec%2BhoKWkmaW9pnnToamor6NiwLC5xGaqoZmUmnqiwIyeo6WdnmKxprPEp5yrnaNirq61w2afnqpdqby5tcJmrqiqm2Kyr8LIq6anpZWjwW6%2FwpqlnZmcYoF2fJBrbmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
